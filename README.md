# MapDeciphering
Program to decipher and analyze Hexagonal Maps
The program is designed to solve a series of questions related to a hexagonal treasure map. Part A requires a function in C that returns all the adjacent points around an inputted point, which are sorted first by the first coordinate, and then the second coordinate. Part B requires a function that finds the total value of all the treasure found in a map. Part B requires a function that finds the total value of all the treasure found in a map. The time complexity of the algorithm in terms of sea, land, and treasure points is described.  Part D requires a function that finds the shortest path between two points on the map, where the time it takes to move to an adjacent point is determined by the current point you are on.
